# 2D_TerrainDeformation
Draws a line on screen and allows the user to deform it with mouse clicks

It's pretty rough overall, but it pretty much fulfills the original idea given by a friend.

Use
-Left/right click to deform the terrain (down and up)
-Click and drag to move the view
-The form for points at the bottom is for the recommended number of points in the terrain (is not the true number because of rounding errors caused by converting doubles to ints)
-The slider at the side is to zoom in and out on the terrain. The presentation is pretty rough when zoomed out, but it works for now.


Feel free to do whatever the heck you want to with this code. 
  Receiving credit for the initial code would be lovely, if you are feeling generous.

I tried to be sufficiently detailed when commenting my code, so look there if you want more info. well, that's obvious i guess.
